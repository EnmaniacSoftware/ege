Corresponding OS/Device implementation modules can refer to Implementation in Core - HMM...
Another modules can only refer to Interfaces
Interface does not automatically mean 'available to clients of framework' !!!
Framework clients can only use public EGExxx.h hearders
Interface modules can be refered by components in the framework


Coding standards:

Initialization list syntax

Ala::Ala()
: Ola()
, ela(1)
...


Struct vs Class

If all methods and data members are public struct can be used. Otherwise, use class.

Include order:

- alphabetical
- starting with local ones ""
- first one which does not refer to any subfolder ie #include "ala.h" and later ones that goes into subfolders ie #include "ola/ola.h"
- then external ones <>
