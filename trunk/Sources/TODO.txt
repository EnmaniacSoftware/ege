
FEATURES:

- Make possible to create multiple SceneManagers thru EGEngine
- OpenGL highest version detection and fallback mechanism for renderers
- RenderQueue:
  - seperate solid and transparent objects (based on material?) and depth-sort transparent ones
- VertexBuffer:
  - add some method/way to instruct of creation of common vertex types in 1 call ie. one call to build vertex semantics for V3T2C4 or V3T2

* Resources
  - Manual resources. The way to create resources in runtime ie. render textures, which can be used even in resource definitions
  - Physical textures should be defined by 'texture' resources. All references should be done to 'texture-image' resources.

OPTIMIZATIONS:

- SceneNodeObject:
  - render components cache or map to quickly add them for rendering
  
- Camera
  - view matrix is calculated each time getViewMatrix is called as there is no information from PhysicsComponent regarding internal value changes
    This is not a big issue as this method should be called rather infrequently

- Files

  - write and read pointers are now the same, perhaps we can distinquish them

CODING:
